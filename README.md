Technical Overview
-------------------------
The development of this game has specific criteria as per ludare's specifications. A .pdf will be supplied to developers that continue to work on it.

Rather than the above stated criteria,
1) Every object in the game is comprised of unity's default sprites.
2) Color palete, and audio are 'Synthwave' inspired.
3) Player feedback and visuals are prioritized in every design aspect.
